# jsm2018

At JSM 2018 in Vancouver, I am giving two presentations.

- In a session on text mining for abstract classification, I am [acting as discussant](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215257).
- In a session on modern options for academic publication, I am speaking on ["Growing a Book in the Open: From Blog Post to O'Reilly Paperback"](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215035).

This repo contains materials for both talks.
